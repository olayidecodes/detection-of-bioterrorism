Detection of Bioterrorism and PM2.5 Prediction Using Random Forest and SARIMA


Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting PM2.5 air pollution levels and detecting anomalies that could indicate bioterrorism threats. Using satellite data, weather information, and machine learning techniques, this system provides an early warning mechanism for public health and security interventions.

The model integrates:
- LightGBM for spatial predictions
- SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) for time-series forecasting
- Hybrid Model (SARIMA + LightGBM) to enhance predictive accuracy

 🏗️ Features
✅ Air Pollution Forecasting: Predicts PM2.5 concentrations based on satellite and weather data.
✅ Hybrid Model: Combines statistical and machine learning models for improved accuracy.
✅ Real-Time Monitoring Potential: Designed for integration with continuous air quality tracking systems.
✅ Anomaly Detection: Identifies unusual patterns in PM2.5 that could signal bioterrorism risks.
